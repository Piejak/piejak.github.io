# Piejak

This is really just a place to host odd experiments and miscellaneous little projects that I do.

List of what is on this site:
  1. A site that decides on a conversation topic or a date location (piejak.github.io/choice.html)
  2. A clock that counts in a stupid base 10 time system that I came up with (piejak.github.io/metric.html)
  3. Just a little homepage (piejak.github.io)
  4. A prototype dating site made for the purpose of learning bootstrap (piejak.github.io/meatcover.html)
